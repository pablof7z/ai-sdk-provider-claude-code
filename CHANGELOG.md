and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.4] - 2025-12-04

### Changed

- **Updated Claude Agent SDK to ^0.1.59** - Fixes Apple notarization failures for macOS Electron apps
  - The SDK removed the bundled JetBrains plugin which contained unsigned macOS native binaries (`jansi-2.4.1.jar`)
  - This eliminates notarization errors for macOS apps that include the SDK as a dependency
  - See [claude-agent-sdk-typescript#91](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/issues/91) for details

## [2.2.3] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed

- **True object streaming** - `streamObject()` now streams partial objects incrementally instead of returning the complete object at the end
  - Added handling for `input_json_delta` events from the SDK's internal `StructuredOutput` tool
  - The AI SDK's `parsePartialJson()` now receives incremental JSON updates to build partial objects
  - **Before**: 1 partial object delivered only at completion
  - **After**: ~100+ partial objects streamed as JSON is generated, enabling real-time UI updates

## [2.2.2] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed

- **True text streaming** - `streamText()` now streams text token-by-token instead of returning all text in a single chunk
  - Enabled SDK's `includePartialMessages` option by default in `doStream()`
  - Added handling for `stream_event` messages to extract `text_delta` events
  - Implemented deduplication to avoid duplicate text when assistant messages arrive with cumulative content
  - **Before**: 1 chunk, ~23 second wait before any text appeared
  - **After**: ~192 chunks, ~3.5 seconds to first chunk, ~12 chars average per chunk

### Changed

- Improved type safety by using SDK's `SDKPartialAssistantMessage` type instead of inline type assertions

## [2.2.0] - 2025-11-22

### Added

- **Native structured outputs** - `generateObject()` and `streamObject()` now use SDK's `outputFormat` option with guaranteed schema compliance via constrained decoding
- `supportsStructuredOutputs = true` - Provider now advertises native structured outputs support to AI SDK
- Proper error handling for `error_max_structured_output_retries` SDK response
- Export `OutputFormat` type from the SDK

### Changed

- **Upgraded Claude Agent SDK to ^0.1.50** - Now uses SDK's native structured outputs feature
- Simplified internal JSON handling - removed prompt-based JSON instructions in favor of SDK's `outputFormat`
- Removed internal `extractJson` utility and `jsonc-parser` dependency (internal implementation detail, not part of public API)
- **Breaking behavior change**: Schema-less `responseFormat: { type: 'json' }` is now treated as unsupported (matching Anthropic's official provider behavior). An `unsupported-setting` warning is emitted and the call is treated as plain text. Use a schema with `generateObject()`/`streamObject()` for guaranteed JSON output.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added

- **Comprehensive debug logging and verbose mode** - Enhanced logging capabilities for better debugging and troubleshooting
  - Added `debug` and `info` log levels to complement existing `warn` and `error` levels
  - New `verbose` setting to control debug/info logging visibility
  - Detailed execution tracing including request/response flow, tool calls, stream events, and token usage
  - `createVerboseLogger()` utility that filters debug/info logs based on verbose mode
  - When `verbose: false` (default), only `warn` and `error` messages are logged
  - When `verbose: true`, all log levels including `debug` and `info` are logged
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all logging scenarios and custom logger implementations

### Potentially Breaking Changes

**Who is affected:** Only users with custom `Logger` implementations (estimated <5% of users).

**What changed:** The `Logger` interface now requires 4 methods instead of 2:

- `debug(message: string): void` - NEW - for detailed execution tracing (verbose mode only)
- `info(message: string): void` - NEW - for general flow information (verbose mode only)
- `warn(message: string): void` - existing
- `error(message: string): void` - existing

**Migration for custom logger users:**

```typescript
// Before (v2.0.x) ❌
const logger = {
  warn: (msg) => myLogger.warn(msg),
  error: (msg) => myLogger.error(msg),
};

// After (v2.1.0+) ✅
const logger = {
  debug: (msg) => myLogger.debug(msg), // Add this
  info: (msg) => myLogger.info(msg), // Add this
  warn: (msg) => myLogger.warn(msg),
  error: (msg) => myLogger.error(msg),
};
```

**Most users are unaffected:**

- Users without a custom logger (using default `console`) - no changes needed
- Users with `logger: false` - no changes needed
- The default logger automatically handles all log levels

### Fixed

- Corrected debug log message that was logging string length instead of message count
  - Was: `messagesPrompt.length` (string character count)
  - Now: `options.prompt.length` (actual message count)
  - Also added `hasImageParts` flag to the log for better visibility

### Changed

- **Default logger now includes level tags** - All log messages are prefixed with `[DEBUG]`, `[INFO]`, `[WARN]`, or `[ERROR]` for clarity
- Updated documentation with comprehensive logging and verbose mode examples
- Added integration tests for logger functionality in real provider usage scenarios
- Improved JSDoc comments for logger interface and functions

## [2.0.5] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Fixed truncation detection false negatives in `isClaudeCodeTruncationError`
  - Removed incorrect position proximity check that compared JSON parser position (full payload) against assistant text length
  - Position comparison was comparing apples to oranges: parser position measures full JSON payload (~200+ chars) vs extracted text (~11 chars), causing `Math.abs(position - bufferedText.length) <= 16` to almost always fail
  - This bug prevented the graceful truncation recovery path from ever running, causing all truncations to throw errors instead of returning buffered text
  - Now relies solely on truncation indicator patterns and minimum content length (512 chars) for accurate detection
  - Simplified logic removes unnecessary `hasUnclosedJsonStructure` helper and `POSITION_PATTERN` regex
  - Added comprehensive documentation explaining why position checks are not feasible with current SDK layer
  - Enhanced cross-runtime compatibility by checking error name for cross-realm SyntaxError instances
  - Added additional truncation indicator patterns: "unexpected eof", "end of file", "unterminated string constant"

### Changed

- Improved documentation in `isClaudeCodeTruncationError` function explaining truncation detection strategy
- Lowered minimum truncation length threshold from 1024 to 512 characters for better recovery on shorter responses
- Updated warning message to reference "SDK" instead of "CLI" for consistency with v2.x terminology
- Clarified that content length is measured in UTF-16 code units, not byte length

## [2.0.4] - 2025-10-19

### Added

- Full support for Zod 4.x while maintaining backward compatibility with Zod 3.x
- New comprehensive Zod 4 compatibility test suite (`examples/zod4-compatibility-test.ts`)
- Added `example:zod4` npm script to run Zod 4 compatibility tests

### Changed

- Updated function schema validation to use version-agnostic `refine()` approach for maximum compatibility
- Upgraded development dependency from Zod 3.25.76 to Zod 4.1.12
- Updated README.md with Zod compatibility documentation

### Fixed

- Fixed Zod 4 compatibility issue in `claudeCodeSettingsSchema` validation
- Fixed overly restrictive password regex in `generate-object-constraints.ts` example
- Package now works seamlessly with both Zod 3.x and Zod 4.x installations
- Tool calls for built-in tools (Bash, Read, Write, etc.) no longer marked as invalid (#63)
  - Added `dynamic: true` flag to all tool stream parts (tool-input-start, tool-call, tool-result, tool-error)
  - AI SDK now correctly treats Claude Code's built-in tools as dynamic provider-executed tools
  - Eliminates `NoSuchToolError` and `invalid: true` flags without requiring user action
  - Transparent fix - no code changes required from users

## [2.0.3] - 2025-10-16

### Added

- Support for Claude 4.5 Haiku model (`haiku`) - Available in Claude Code v2.0.17+ (#59)

### Fixed

- Improved truncation detection to avoid false positives on malformed JSON (#60)
  - Added multi-layered validation: position-based, structure validation, minimum size guard, and truncation indicators
  - Prevents genuine JSON syntax errors from being incorrectly treated as CLI truncation events
- Updated `MinimalCallToolResult` type to match MCP SDK specification (#60)
  - Added missing `resource_link` content type
  - Split resource type into text/blob variants with proper discriminated unions
  - Resolves TypeScript compilation errors in downstream projects using MCP SDK v1.13+

### Changed

- Updated `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` from `^0.1.0` to `^0.1.20`
- Updated all example files to use `haiku` model for faster execution
- Updated Quick Start examples in README.md to use `haiku` model
- Updated model version references to Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 in documentation

## [2.0.2] - 2025-10-02

### Changed

- Updated README.md npm tag documentation from `v1` to `v1-claude-code-sdk` (#56)
- Added explicit installation examples for all versions (v2.x, v1.x, v0.x)

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-02

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Migrate to Claude Agent SDK

This release migrates from `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` to `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`.

- System prompt is no longer applied by default.
  - Migration: set `systemPrompt: { type: 'preset', preset: 'claude_code' }` to restore the previous default.
- Filesystem settings (CLAUDE.md, settings.json) are not loaded by default.
  - Migration: set `settingSources: ['user','project','local']` to restore the previous default.
- All imports referring to the SDK should now use `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`.

#### Legacy fields deprecated

- `customSystemPrompt` and `appendSystemPrompt` are deprecated in favor of `systemPrompt`.
  - For append-only behavior, use `{ type: 'preset', preset: 'claude_code', append: '<text>' }`.
  - In 2.x, these fields are mapped internally to `systemPrompt` for compatibility and may log a deprecation warning; they will be removed in 3.0.

### Changed

- Switched SDK dependency to `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` and updated re-exports accordingly.
- Added support for Agent SDK `systemPrompt` (string or preset with optional `append`) and `settingSources`.
- Updated documentation and examples to reflect new defaults and migration steps.
- Streaming warning text updated to mention “Claude Agent SDK features …”.

### Notes

- Provider ID and `providerMetadata` keys remain `claude-code` for compatibility. This may change in a future major release.

## [1.1.3] - 2025-09-03

### Fixed

- Fixed `canUseTool` hanging issue when using streaming input by holding input stream open until Claude returns results (#43)

## [1.1.2] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- Provider-level streaming input support to enable `canUseTool` via the SDK's stream-json mode (`streamingInput: 'auto' | 'always' | 'off'`).
- Pass-through support for hooks and `canUseTool` to the Claude Code SDK (with guard against `permissionPromptToolName`).
- Re-exports for SDK MCP tool utilities: `createSdkMcpServer`, `tool`, and related hook/permission types.
- Helper `createCustomMcpServer` to simplify in-process MCP tool registration.
- Examples: hooks-callbacks and sdk-tools-callbacks.
- Documentation: new sections on Custom SDK Tools (callbacks) and Hooks/Runtime Permissions; clarified `canUseTool` streaming requirement and usage.

### Changed

- Updated README and GUIDE to reflect that `canUseTool` is supported when streaming input is enabled (no longer "blocked").
